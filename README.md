# How Temporal and Geographical Factors can Improve a Sale Price Prediction Model in Toronto
This repository shows an analysis of the Toronto housing market from 2014 to 2023 including the influence of financial, crime, and local factors. A model is created using this analysis to compare how those factors influence the final sale price.

# The Notebooks:
The notebooks are listed 1-9, the order in which they should be run. Notebooks 1 and 2 involved scraping and cleaning the housing data. Notebooks 3-5 contain the code for combining the additional features such as nearby infrastructure (Notebook 3), nearby amenities and features (Notebook 4), and finally the main notebook (Notebook 5). The main notebook combines the previous notebooks, adding financial and crime features. It also exports the test and train csv files for the model. Notebook 6 contains all the code required to train and run the model. The final 3 notebooks contain different types of visualizations.
